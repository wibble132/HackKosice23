# HackKosice23

Our submission "Rolan do bos" for Hack Ko≈°ice 2023!

It was a challenge posed by [BSH](https://www.bsh-group.com/) to achieve a series of tasks on an LED matrix atop of a microcontroller, and control with the gyroscope (which was achieved with some levels of success!).

Additionally, the `HackKosiceUsbSerial` folder contains a Windows Form application that shows a simple example of how communication between the controller and a computer could be achieved, once USB is working on the board.
